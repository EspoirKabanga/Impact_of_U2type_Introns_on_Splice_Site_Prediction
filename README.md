# Impact of U2-type Introns on Splice Site Prediction in Arabidopsis Thaliana using Deep Learning
In this study, we explore how intron characteristics affect the effectiveness of splice site predictions in Arabidopsis thaliana using deep learning. 

## Data

The dataset used in this work can be downloaded from https://zenodo.org/records/11178747. The original data was compile and organized by [Degroeve S., et al](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/21/8/1332/249398).
The annotated U2-type introns from IAOD database can be downloaded from https://introndb.lerner.ccf.org/static/fasta/TAIR10_U2.fasta.

## Code

The codes can be found in the **src** directory. The code was run using `Python 3.9.13` and `TensorFlow 2.10.1`. You can run the models using `Main.py`. Please make sure to change the paths before running the codes.
The codes for generating the sequence logos will be made available soon.
